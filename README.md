*NeuronAnimator* is a minimum-required subset of the [Perception Neuron][Neuron]
SDK for Unity. This plugin is aiming to provide the following points:

**Retargeting**

The original SDK doesn't support retargeting and models have to be rigged in a
very specific way. With this plugin, you can use any humanoid model with Neuron.

**Simpleness**

There is only one component -- all you have to do is just adding NeuronAnimator
to a game object.

**Robustness**

The original SDK is thread-unsafe and frequently crashes in some environments.
The entire code has been overhauled in this plugin. Should work robustly!

Current status of the project
-----------------------------

This plugin is still under development and not in the final quality. Any feedback
is welcomed :)
